PlayerPawn

Input variables
===============================================================================
aLookUp:	Keyboard look up / down, aliased to LookUp / LookDown in game
aTurn:		?


PlayerTick()
- Called after Tick()
- PlayerPawn only implements this function in states
- if bUpdatePosition -> ClientUpdatePosition()
- Calls PlayerMove()

	PlayerMove()
	- Scales input axes
	- Updates rotation (?)
	- Calculates new acceleration based on input axes
	- IF CLIENT --> calls ReplicateMove()
	- IF SERVER --> calls ProcessMove()

		ReplicateMove()
		- Only ever gets called on the Client, only one implementation
		- Sets up a linked list of SavedMoves
		- Calls ProcessMove() to simulate the movement locally
		- If it's too early to send a new move to the server, breaks here
		- Otherwise, calls ServerMove()
		
			ServerMove()
			- Called on the server ONLY if replicated from a Client. Never called for standalone
			- Acts as a receiver from the ReplicateMove() function
			- Process lost packet if found, and calls MoveAutonomous() for it
			- Check is player tried to fire, calls Fire() if so
			- Calls MoveAutonomous() for the current move
			- If the client has accumulated positional error, call ClientAdjustPosition()
			
				ClientAdjustPosition()
				- Replicated from the server to AutonomousProxies ONLY
				- Adjusts location / velocity / base to match the server
				- The only function that sets bUpdatePosition to true
				- bUpdatePosition = true causes PlayerTick() to call ClientUpdatePosition()
				
				ClientUpdatePosition()
				- Calls MoveAutonomous() for each SavedMove
				- Turns off bUpdatePosition flag
